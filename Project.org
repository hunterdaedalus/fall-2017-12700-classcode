* Inverted Index Project
*** Specifications
- Two person groups
- make a single folder in one of your homework reps. Name it
  *project*
- Make sure to add your partner as a collaborator. I expect to see
  commits from both users throughout the course of the project.
- The folder should contain a README.md file which should contain:
  - The names of both group members
  - A description of the project
  - Instructions as to how to run/test the project
- For a top grade you will be expected to extend the project using a
  tool, library, or technique we didn't cover in class. This will be
  described in the extended requirements section below.
*** Basic requirements
**** Choice 1
- Start with the Inverted Index 
- Store (and use) additional info in the index such as:
  - how many times each word occurs (use a tuple)
  - The position of the word (where it starts)
  - Storing the stemmed word instead of all the words
- Add the ability to do *AND*, *NOT* and *OR* queries.
- Find or create an alternate data set from offenders-cleaned.csv
**** Choice 2
- Start with the Text generator
- Break up the text into n-grams (2, 3, 4 as needed)
- Analyze the text or multiple texts in interesting ways:
  - Look for names (how would you find a name?) and where they appear
    alone and with each other.
  - Are some phrases (2-grams, 3-grams, etc) common? Common across
    texts?
 
*** Extended requirements
Here are some ways you should extend the project. You don't have to do
all of them and if you have other ideas, speak to the instructor about them.
- Look at most common words after removing words in a stop word list
  (http://www.lextek.com/manuals/onix/stopwords1.html).
- Add a stemming library and use that in your word searches.
- Look up a simple stemming algorithm and implement it.
- Put it up as a web app (Flask) - for example use a form to input a
  query to the data set.
- Use a graph library to visualize some of your explorations

*** Alternate project 
You may propose an alternate project to the one specified here but
make sure that you have the instructors approval prior to
starting. Any proposed alternate project must make use of the same set
of tools and techniques as the inverted index project does.
